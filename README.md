## Architecture

The project follows the MVVM pattern.
- Networking is handled in a separate "Network" file.
- All UI components can be found in the View folder.
- The ViewModel folder contains files that handle how data from the backend is displayed in the UI.
- The Model folder contains all the models used through the project- Business, Hours, and Timings.

## Notes
- Alamofire is used to make the API call. The package was installed using Swift Package Manager.
- The backend response is formatted into a custom "Hours" object, then compressed to combine different hours(TimeRange) for the same day (Timings). The hours are sorted and combined in case of overlapping/ continuous range.
- Font styles are downloaded into respective folders and declared in the Info.plist file.
